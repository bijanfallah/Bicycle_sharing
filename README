# Neural Nets to predict the daily bike rental based on meteorological conditions

** check the jupyter notebook for the analysis **


In this project, you'll build your first neural network and use it to predict daily bike rental ridership. We've provided some of the code, but left the implementation of the neural network up to you (for the most part). After you've submitted this project, feel free to explore the data and the model more.
